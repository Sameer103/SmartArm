# SmartArm
(Multi-Armed Bandits with Per-Arm Features to create the recommendation system)

## Marketing Campaign Optimization with Reinforcement Learning
This project aims to develop and deploy a Proof-of-Concept (POC) recommender system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) and Per-Arm Features for marketing campaigns.

## Project Goals:

* Personalize marketing campaigns by selecting the best template (email, text message, etc.) for each user.
* Optimize user engagement through A/B testing and exploration vs. exploitation strategies.
* Gain insights into user behavior and preferences.
  
## Technical Approach:

* Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with Per-Arm Features: This RL technique allows us to make optimal decisions among multiple choices (templates) with unknown rewards (user interactions).
** Each template (arm) will be characterized by features like type (upsell, discount) and user attributes (age, gender).
** The system will learn which features are most likely to lead to desired outcomes (clicks, purchases) over time.
* Machine Learning Libraries: We will leverage Python libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow Bandit for MAB algorithms and model development.
* Cloud Deployment (Optional): For initial POC, a lightweight solution might suffice. However, consider deploying the model on a scalable platform like AWS SageMaker for future production use.
  
## System Functionality:

* Template & User Data Input:
Provide a list of marketing templates with their features.
Include a list of users with their contact information and relevant attributes.
* MAB Recommender:
The model selects the best template for each user based on learned features and user attributes.
* Campaign Execution:
The system sends the recommended template to the user.
Feedback Loop:
User interactions (clicks, purchases) are recorded as rewards and fed back to the model.
The model continuously learns and improves its selection strategy based on this feedback.

## POC Scope:

* This initial deployment will target a limited number of customers for testing and validation purposes.
* Scalability and high availability features will be addressed in future iterations if the POC proves successful.
  
## Next Steps:

* Develop the RL model using MAB with Per-Arm Features.
* Implement interfaces for template definition, user interaction, and reward feedback.
* Deploy the POC model on a suitable platform (local or cloud-based).
* Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the RL-based recommender system compared to traditional methods.
* Refine the model and deployment strategy based on the POC results.
  
This project offers a promising approach to optimize marketing campaigns by leveraging user data and real-time feedback. The POC will provide valuable insights to inform future development and potential scaling for broader deployment.
